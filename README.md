## Liveries

This livery pack provides 5 additional livery templates for each of the two TfL S7 Stock wagons in the **TfL S7 Stock Modpack** mod. These livery templates each have multiple overlays that can be customized by players while in game to create many different livery designs.  These liveries are generic in that they are not intended to represent any particular railway.  Also included are several predefined liveries that showcase some of the custom livery design possibilities when using the included templates.
